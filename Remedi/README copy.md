## Project Description

Remedi will be a mobile application using React Native for users to find home or public remedys for their symptoms. These symptoms will include headache, stomache, bloated, fatigued, and good. The user will set any food preferences they may have which will then filter their search. The user will then be sent to the search results page and from there will be forwarded to either How To Make It or Where To Buy It!
